### What is XOR?
XOR, or exclusive or, is a Boolean logical operator. It takes in two strings of bits, and outputs their exclusive disjunction. Formally, XOR is a binary operation between binary vectors of length $$n$$, denoted by $$\oplus$$:

$$ \oplus : \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^n $$

The output of XOR is encapsulated in the below truth table:

A   | B  | Output  
:-: | :-:| :-:|
0   | 0   | 0
0   | 1   | 1
1   | 0   | 1
1   | 1   | 0

The XOR operation can be summarised as "either one, but not both nor none". As an analogy, imagine you and a friend each have a Dominos Meatilicious Pizza, and decide to have a pizza-eating race. Only one of you can eat the Meatilicious Pizza fastest - only one of you will win. There cannot be two winners and there cannot be no winner.

The XOR operation can also be defined using the primitive Boolean algebra operations - AND ($$\land$$), NOT ($$\lnot$$), and OR ($$\lor$$). We can express $$a$$ XOR $$b$$ as:

$$ a \oplus b \equiv (\lnot{a} \land b) \lor (a \land \lnot{b}) $$

or equivalently:

$$ a \oplus b \equiv (\lnot(a) \lor \lnot(b)) \land (a \lor b) $$
