### What is XOR?
XOR, or exclusive or, is a Boolean logical operator. It takes in two strings of bits, and outputs their exclusive disjunction. Formally, XOR is a binary operation between binary vectors of length $$n$$, denoted by $$\oplus$$:

$$ \oplus : \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^n $$

When $$n > 1$$, XOR operates pairwise on each index.

The output of XOR is encapsulated in the below truth table:

A   | B  | Output  
:-: | :-:| :-:|
0   | 0   | 0
0   | 1   | 1
1   | 0   | 1
1   | 1   | 0

The XOR operation can be summarised as "either one, but not both nor none". As an analogy, imagine you and a friend each have a Dominos Meatilicious Pizza, and decide to have a pizza-eating race. Only one of you can eat the Meatilicious Pizza fastest - only one of you will win. There cannot be two winners and there cannot be no winner.

The XOR operation can also be defined using the primitive Boolean algebra operations - AND ($$\land$$), NOT ($$\lnot$$), and OR ($$\lor$$). We can express $$a$$ XOR $$b$$ as:

$$ a \oplus b \equiv (\lnot{a} \land b) \lor (a \land \lnot{b}) $$

or equivalently:

$$ a \oplus b \equiv (\lnot(a) \lor \lnot(b)) \land (a \lor b) $$

### Abelian Groups

Turns out, the XOR operator with binary vectors forms not just a group, but an abelian group! We will now prove this using the group axioms. For a refresher on the definition and axioms of a group, check out the [Defining Geometric Shapes with Group Theory](/maths/defining-geometric-shapes-group-theory) article.

We first note that since XOR is a binary operation, it is closed. This can be trivially seen with the truth table above - using just $$1$$s and $$0$$s, there is not way to get another symbol.

Next, we consider associativity. For associativity to hold, we need $$ (a \oplus b ) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c)$$ for any $$a, b, c \in \{0,1}^n$$. Since XOR operates pairwise, we only need to consider $$2^3 = 8$$ possibilities. They are listed below.

$$ (0 \oplus 0) \oplus 0 = 0 = 0 \oplus (0 \oplus 0) $$
$$ (0 \oplus 0) \oplus 1 = 1 = 0 \oplus (0 \oplus 1) $$
$$ (0 \oplus 1) \oplus 0 = 1 = 0 \oplus (1 \oplus 0) $$
$$ (0 \oplus 1) \oplus 1 = 0 = 0 \oplus (1 \oplus 1) $$
$$ (1 \oplus 0) \oplus 0 = 1 = 1 \oplus (0 \oplus 0) $$
$$ (1 \oplus 0) \oplus 1 = 0 = 1 \oplus (0 \oplus 1) $$
$$ (1 \oplus 1) \oplus 0 = 0 = 1 \oplus (1 \oplus 0) $$
$$ (1 \oplus 1) \oplus 1 = 1 = 1 \oplus (1 \oplus 1) $$

We see that associativity holds for every possible case.

The $$n$$-bit string of $$0$$s is the identity element, $$e$$. Indeed:
$$ 0 \oplus 0 = 0 $$
and
$$ 0 \oplus 1 = 1 $$

So the identity property is satisfied.

Each element is its own inverse. Indeed:
$$ 0 \oplus 0 = 0 = e $$
and
$$ 1 \oplus 1 = 0 = e $$.

So each element has an inverse.

Hence we have shown that XOR with binary vectors indeed forms a group. We can also note that this group is commutative - $$ 0 \oplus 1 = 1 = 1 \oplus 0 $$. Hence we have an abelian group.
