### Introduction

In this article, we will be exploring one of those proofs that proves a simple concept, with completely overpowered mathematics. There are some mathematical statements that seem to have a multitude of different proofs. The statement we will be proving is that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The overpowered mathematics we will be using comes from topology - namely Furstenberg's topology on the integers.

[Hillel Furstenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_Furstenberg) is a German mathematician who cooked up a topology on the integers, and used this to prove the infinitude of the primes - all whilst he was an undergraduate at Yeshiva University in New York.

We start by exploring arithmetic progressions of integers.
