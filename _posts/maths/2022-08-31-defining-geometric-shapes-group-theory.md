Today we will go through a nice application of group theory - defining geometric shapes through the language of group isomorphisms. This article is based off [this video]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBNJE2922V0&ab_channel=MichaelPenn" Can you define shapes and surfaces with Abstract Algebra?) by Michael Penn.

### Preliminary Definitions
If you do not have a basic understanding of group theory, I'd recommend you learn the basics before embarking on this article. A great introductory video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KufsL2VgELo&ab_channel=Nemean) and a fantastic series with a focus on intuition can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcSwjT2BF_VuNbn8HiHZKKy59SgnIAeO).

A group is simply a collection, or set, of objects equipped with some operation between each object. This operation must:
* Take in two objects in the set and return a third object in the set (closure)
* If you perform the operation on three (or more) objects, the order in which you do it does not matter (associativity)
* There is a special object in the set, say $$\mathit{e}$$, such that when you perform the operation with this object and another, you get the
